# ExecutionHandle

Cooperative cancellation handle returned by
`AgentRuntime.executeWithHandle(context, session)`. Phase 2 of the unified
`@Agent` API closes Correctness Invariant #2 (Terminal Path Completeness) by
giving callers a first-class way to abort an in-flight chat completion. The
handle wraps each runtime's native cancel primitive so the same external API
cancels any backend.

## Interface

```java
public interface ExecutionHandle {

    /**
     * Request cancellation of the in-flight execution. Idempotent — subsequent
     * calls are no-ops. Implementations fire the runtime's native cancel
     * primitive and complete whenDone() once the native pipeline has observed
     * the cancellation.
     */
    void cancel();

    /** @return true once the execution has terminated (completion, error, cancel). */
    boolean isDone();

    /**
     * @return a future that resolves when the execution terminates.
     * Consumers can chain resource cleanup on this without blocking.
     */
    CompletableFuture<Void> whenDone();
}
```

## Runtime cancel primitives

Each adapter wraps its framework's native cancel mechanism so a single
`handle.cancel()` call does the right thing on any backend:

| Runtime | Native primitive | Hard cancel |
|---------|------------------|:-----------:|
| Built-in        | `HttpClient` request + SSE `InputStream.close()` | ✅ true HTTP-level cancel |
| Google ADK      | `AdkEventAdapter.whenDone()` + `Flux.dispose()` on Runner subscription | ✅ Reactor disposal |
| JetBrains Koog  | `coroutineContext[Job].cancel()` captured inside `runBlocking` | ✅ coroutine cancel |
| Spring AI       | `Disposable.dispose()` on the streaming `Flux` | ✅ Reactor disposal |
| LangChain4j     | `CompletableFuture.completeExceptionally(CancellationException)` + soft-cancel flag | ⚠️ caller-side unblock; underlying HTTP drains naturally |
| Embabel         | Soft-cancel flag polled at goal boundaries | ⚠️ cooperative only |
| Semantic Kernel | Soft-cancel flag polled at message boundaries | ⚠️ cooperative only |

"Hard cancel" means the underlying HTTP or coroutine is actually torn down.
"Cooperative" means the caller sees cancellation immediately but the
runtime's internal thread continues draining the stream until the LLM
finishes — token budgets may still be consumed.

## Usage

```java
var handle = runtime.executeWithHandle(context, session);

// The execution runs asynchronously. Do other work.
doSomethingElse();

// User hits Cancel in the UI — abort the LLM call
handle.cancel();

// Wait for the runtime to fully release resources before continuing
handle.whenDone().whenComplete((result, error) -> {
    if (error instanceof CancellationException) {
        logger.info("Agent execution cancelled");
    } else if (error != null) {
        logger.error("Agent execution failed", error);
    } else {
        logger.info("Agent execution completed normally");
    }
    cleanupSessionResources();
});
```

`cancel()` is idempotent and thread-safe — it's safe to call from any
thread, including the completion callback itself. `whenDone()` returns the
same future on every call and is also safe to chain from any thread.

## Terminal-reason race

`CompletableFuture` is first-write-wins. If `cancel()` and a natural
completion (either success or error) race each other, observers chained on
`whenDone()` see whichever fired first:

- `cancel()` wins → future completes with `CancellationException`
- natural completion wins → future completes normally or with the runtime's error

**A real error that arrives strictly after `cancel()` is silently dropped.**
If your telemetry needs to distinguish "cancelled by caller" from "errored
after cancel arrived," check `isCancelled()` explicitly inside your
`whenComplete` callback:

```java
handle.whenDone().whenComplete((result, error) -> {
    if (handle.isCancelled()) {
        // Caller explicitly cancelled — may or may not have also seen an error
        recordCancellation();
    } else if (error != null) {
        recordError(error);
    } else {
        recordSuccess();
    }
});
```

Never rely on the exception type alone — `CancellationException` could
arrive because the caller cancelled OR because a downstream stage (e.g.
LC4j's internal future) completed exceptionally with that type.

## `ExecutionHandle.completed()`

Runtimes that don't override `executeWithHandle` return a sentinel already-
terminated handle:

```java
static ExecutionHandle completed() { return COMPLETED; }
```

- `cancel()` → no-op
- `isDone()` → `true`
- `whenDone()` → already-completed future

Use it when you're wrapping a synchronous API and want to preserve the
`ExecutionHandle` return type without adding real cancel support.

## `ExecutionHandle.Settable` — CAS-guarded cancel flag

For runtimes that only need a simple cancel flag + completion future,
`ExecutionHandle.Settable` gives you a ready-made implementation:

```java
public final class Settable implements ExecutionHandle {
    private final CompletableFuture<Void> done = new CompletableFuture<>();
    private final AtomicBoolean cancelled = new AtomicBoolean();
    private final Runnable nativeCancel;  // may be null

    public Settable(Runnable nativeCancel) {
        this.nativeCancel = nativeCancel;
    }

    @Override
    public void cancel() {
        if (cancelled.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
            if (nativeCancel != null) {
                nativeCancel.run();  // fire the runtime's native primitive
            }
        }
    }

    public void complete() { done.complete(null); }
    public void completeExceptionally(Throwable error) { done.completeExceptionally(error); }
    public boolean isCancelled() { return cancelled.get(); }

    @Override public boolean isDone() { return done.isDone(); }
    @Override public CompletableFuture<Void> whenDone() { return done; }
}
```

Runtimes that have a richer native cancel primitive should wrap it
directly instead of using `Settable` — for example, Koog stores the
`runBlocking` `Job` reference and cancels it, ADK disposes the
`Flux` subscription, Built-in closes the HTTP `InputStream`.

## Integration with approval gates

`ExecutionHandle.cancel()` cooperates with `@RequiresApproval`:

- Tool sits in the approval queue waiting on `ApprovalStrategy.virtualThread()`
- User hits Cancel instead of Approve/Deny
- `handle.cancel()` fires
- The virtual thread parked on the approval is interrupted
- The tool is rejected with "execution cancelled"
- `onError(CancellationException)` fires on lifecycle listeners
- `whenDone()` completes with `CancellationException`

See [Durable Checkpoints](../checkpoint/) for the pattern where an
approval arrives across a process restart — the `ExecutionHandle` is
discarded on the original process and a new one is created on the
resuming process.

## Testing

`OpenAiCompatibleClientCancelTest` exercises the full cancel path against a
local HTTP server that returns SSE tokens slowly. The test asserts:

1. `handle.cancel()` returns immediately
2. `handle.whenDone()` completes within a bounded window
3. The HTTP connection is closed (server observes disconnect)
4. `isCancelled()` returns `true` on the handle
5. Subsequent `cancel()` calls are no-ops

For a cross-runtime cancel contract, see `AbstractAgentRuntimeContractTest`
which asserts the cancel path on each adapter's subclass.
